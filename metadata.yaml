description: An American in Paris at the turn of the nineteenth century, John Durham
  pays court to an old flame, Fanny Frisbee, now married to the dissolute Marquis
  de Malrive. Devoutly Catholic, Fanny's husband is unlikely to grant her a divorce
  or relinquish custody of their young son, who is heir to the family title. When
  the Malrive family, urged by Fanny's enigmatic sister-in-law, Madame de Treymes,
  agrees to a divorce, John must decide whether or not he will pursue a future with
  the woman he loves, but which forces her to give up her son.</ Contrasting the simplicity
  and practicality of John's brownstone in New York with the decadence and beauty
  of the Saint-Germain district of Paris, <Madame de Treymes</ intelligently examines
  the social role of women within two clashing cultures. The novella was inspired
  by Edith Wharton's own entrance into Parisian society, and remains one of her best-loved
  works of fiction.</ HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to
  life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and
